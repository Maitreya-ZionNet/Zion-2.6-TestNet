        <p>And so the master gave the man everything he needed to live and cultivate the land and see that everything was good. But man broke the laws that God, the Father - the almighty spirit of us all, and his Mother Earth gave him, and so Adam and Eve were expelled from Paradise. From the Garden of Eden. And so the time has come when humanity should reconnect with the divinity within us and restore the lost paradise. We are all Adam and Eve, without the original sin, when we separated ourselves from mother nature and the great spirit. All this is to be restored again, so as the Master Christ told us, lift up the stove and you will find me there. The time will come when we all wake up from our dream. And we will all know that I am God. This is our core, our heart. We are all Gods and Goddesses and this system does not want us to know that because they have enslaved our minds with an artificially created value system and created the greatest tool and deception for all of humanity, and that is money. Man has thus forgotten the wealth that he has within himself and he has forgotten the true Value of life that was given to him as a human Adam or Ewa Kadmon.</p>

        <p>{from the book Dohrman's Prophecy - WingsMakers}</p>
        <br>
        <p>Chapter 7. The Era of Light. The Tomb of Darkness</p>
        <br>
        <p>A hand turned the next page with great care. The flowing robe was rolled up on the arm to ensure it could not touch the pages. As the Wizard read, he emanated a deep reverence for the book. In the Era of Light, when the earthly universe breaks through the waters in which it was submerged, a new universe will be born. The sons and daughters of this new universe will perceive anew. They will dance in the gardens of knowledge and enjoy the fruits of other trees. They will unravel from the past mistakes of their race and live free from the old patterns that constrained their heart’s wisdom. They will discover their gold in the language of light, through which many separate existences live in the elegance of Unity. The Era of Light will emerge from many signs of the Creator’s creation. These signs will be encoded in a language unknown to all except the Creator and his servants: the Human Oracles. Many will attempt to interpret these signs, but they will fail to feel their significance. The signs will be drawn in the sand of human thoughts and interpreted by the imprisoned intellect; they will either be feared by wounded hearts or grasped by naive souls. However, the Human Oracles will overturn norms. They will shift values. They will destroy the frameworks of self-care that have infested the Earth. And so it is revealed that as the Oracle of Man becomes human, humans will become the Oracles of Light. This is the only sign that cannot be misinterpreted. It is the only signal from our Creator that a new universe is emerging from its cocoon and that the metamorphosis we have been waiting for stems from a shift visible to none but a select few. An elegant hand briefly touched the white beard and then wiped away a falling tear from the face of the humble master.</p>
